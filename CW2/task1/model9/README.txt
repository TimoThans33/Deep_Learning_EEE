This architecture uses the googlenet/inception V1 with pretrained weights on the
imagenet data set. Also it uses one output layer and the weights in the layers
are frozen and untrainable. This resulted in the following:

a test loss of 5.298528 and a test accuracy of 0.0063


The trianing loss was 5.2983 and the training accuracy 0.0046.

The training time was: 1016.28460 s

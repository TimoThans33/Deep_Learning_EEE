Again we are using the VGG16 architecture but without the pre-trained weights. I added some extra
output layers to increase the complexity of the architecture and hopefully get a better result.

Unfortunately this was not the case. 

The results were a test loss of .978644093322754 and a test accuracy of 0.0324. The training time
was 1123.8061685562134 seconds.

In this model the pretrained weights are fixed. As noticable from model3 there was barely any
overfitting so maybe with  a more complex model we could improve our results. Turns out that 
this is not the case unfortunately. 

The results were a test loss of 2.269762305831909 and a test accuracy of 0.4487
Trainig Time 7.27578 minutes

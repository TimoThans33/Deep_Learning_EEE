This model had an extra output layer and again used the pretrained weigths of the VGG16 architecture

I added the extra dEnse output layer with 4048 units there is a lot of overfitting happening

The results were a test loss of 3.50700585 and a test accuracy of 0.5743

The training time was 18.9 minutes
